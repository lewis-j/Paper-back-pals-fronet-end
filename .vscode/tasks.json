// @Andrew Wolfe had a great point in the comments, asking about workspace activation events. As I implement similar configurations in future projects, I will probably go in that direction.

// Original answer:

// Ended up using @HansPassant's solution: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks#_custom-tasks

// So something similar to this in my .vscode/tasks.json file:

{
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "label": "Launch app", // Name of task
      "type": "shell",
      "command": "npm run start:client", // Enter your command here
      "group": "none",
      "presentation": {
        "reveal": "always",
        "panel": "new"
      },
      "runOptions": {
        "runOn": "folderOpen"
      }
    }
  ]
}
